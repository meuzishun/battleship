// TODO: should be able to place ships at specific coordinates by calling the ship factory
// TODO: should have a receiveAttack function that takes a pair of coordinates, determines whether or not the attack hit a ship and then sends the ‘hit’ function to the correct ship, or records the coordinates of the missed shot
// TODO: should keep track of missed attacks so they can display them properly
// TODO: should be able to report whether or not all of their ships have been sunk
